The terms class and object are related to one another, but each term holds its own distinct meaning.  

The term class refers to the actual written piece of code which is used to define the behaviour of any given class. So, a class is a static piece of code that consists of attributes which don’t change during the execution of a program – like the method definitions within a class.  

The term object, however, refers to an actual instance of a class. Every object must belong to a class. Objects are created and eventually destroyed – so they only live in the program for a limited time. While objects are “living” their properties may also be changed significantly.  

Can for example have the class animal, then when the programs runs instances of animal are created that can for example be set to lion, elephant, zebra etcetera.
