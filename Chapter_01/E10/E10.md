Object oriented programing supports the each of the four goals for software quality. 

The first goal is that the program shall work and it is of course possible to write a program that work using any more or less well known programming language. But using an object oriented language means that many well known good design practices are built in directly into to the language and this improves the quality of the code resulting in a higher likelihood that the final product will work well.

The second goal that states that the software shall be easy to modify and this comes naturally with object orientation since the modular approach makes it simpler to alter a program.

The third goal that a program shall be reusable comes built in to object oriented languages by the means of classes that can be reused in new programs if properly designed.

Object oriented languages are designed for being able to develop software faster and more reliable than with non object oriented languages..This makes it more likely to met the goal of delivering the software on time and within budget.
