Java has four types of access modifiers that gives different levels of visibility when applied on a particular field or method. The following table shows the access to members permitted by each modifier.

Public means visible to all classes everywhere. Protected means visibility inside the class, from classes in the same package, and from a subclass of its own class in another package. Omitting the access modifier means visibility inside the class and from classes in the same package. Private means visibility only from within the class.
