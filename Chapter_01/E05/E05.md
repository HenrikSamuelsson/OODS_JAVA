 In February 2001, 17 software developers met, to discuss lightweight development methods. The result of this meeting was the Manifesto for Agile Software Development to define the approach now known as agile software development. Here follows some statements from people who have read this manifesto.

>“After thirty years of contemplation, experience, and trial. My conclusions are that an agile approach to projects is the only way to accomplish large scale requirements delivery.”

>“At the beginning of my career I thought I have to specify every single detail of a system/program and the reason why not one single project could be finished on time/budget was that I did spend too little on specifying at the beginning. I was so wrong!”

>“I have used these techniques in several places now and find them to be very good at getting the best results with the least cost while protecting human relationships.”
