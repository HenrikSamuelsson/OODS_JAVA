My personal software development “process” can be outlined by the following steps.

*Requirements specification
*Design
*First simplified implementation
*Design modifications
*Testing and documentation
*Extended implementation - adding exception handling and tuning of the user interface
*Testing and documentation
*Optimizations regarding speed and possibly memory usage
*Testing and presentation
