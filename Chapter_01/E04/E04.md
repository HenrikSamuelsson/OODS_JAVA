There is an agile software development method called Scrum. Scrum is based on the following concepts.

* The entire known work that shall be done is maintained in a list that is called the backlog.
* The work schedule is subdivided into work period that are a couple of weeks long, these are called sprints.
* Each sprint is preceded by a sprint planning.
* Each day during the sprint includes a short sprint meeting where the team members briefly present what they did yesterday and what they will do today.
* The goal of the sprint is to have something new at the end of the sprint that can be shipped, started to be sold, or be demonstrated to stakeholders.
* A sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective.
* Scrum based teams shall include a product owner who is responsible for prioritizing of what shall be chosen from the backlog another person acts as a so called Scrum master who  shall lead and keep the team focused on its goal.
