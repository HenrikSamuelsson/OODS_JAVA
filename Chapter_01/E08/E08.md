A software might need to be modified in all the phases of the software life cycle.
1. Design phase changes can be because of contradictions in the requirements.
2. Modifications in the coding phase can for example be because of that the software library to be used proved to lacked support for the particular hardware.
3. Test may fail because of bugs in the code and the code must then be fixed. It can also be the case that the first version of the software is too slow and needs to be optimized.
4. Changes in the maintenance phase are often caused by new demands from the customer. Other reasons can be because of that the environment where the software is used is different than in the testing environment which may cause new problems.
